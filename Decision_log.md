## Security Documentation Decision

Decision: Reject the vendor offer.

Justification:
Skipping security documentation increases residual risk and weakens administrative performance quality.
Without documentation, compliance verification and audit tracing become impossible in case of a security breach.
Long-term regulatory and financial risks outweigh the short-term schedule benefit.
